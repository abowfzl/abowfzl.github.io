<p>Hello There! 👋 I'm Abolfazl :)</p>

``` Your friendly neighborhood software developer and machine learning enthusiast. Having +4 years in online platforms, writing maintainable, scalable, readable, and performant codebases prioritized testable and expressive code with best practices in mind and industry standards.
```

I spend my days (and, let's be real, many late nights) diving into code, crafting innovative solutions, and making machines a little bit smarter. With a passion for problem-solving and a love for all things tech.🤓

Whether it's building robust software from scratch or training algorithms to learn and evolve, I'm all about pushing the boundaries of what's possible. When I'm not glued to my keyboard, you'll find me exploring the latest tech trends, geeking out over new ML models, or sharing my knowledge with the fantastic dev community.

Sharing what we build, how we build it, and the mistakes we made along the way improves the experience and saves time for the next thousands of people doing similar.🤘

Ever since I first laid my hands on my first computer (since Y2018 🪲) I’ve loved computers 🧑‍💻.


Welcome to my digital corner of the world—let's create something awesome together! 🚀✨
