I want to introduce you to a simple tool that can manage the time you work with the computer

When I sit at the computer, I am completely unaware of the clock and time, there is a small software that collects information about what you are doing. and sends it to its server
{: .notice--info}


Analyzing the time you spent on each software, it can help you to be more productive.

For example, #Visual Studio, #Notepad++ or #StackOverflow Websit, and #CodeProject website have a positive rating as a programmer.

And social networks, checking email during work time is a negative point

You can determine in your dashboard whether a certain software or a certain site has a positive score or not

And every week it gives you a report that this week your performance was so much and you were so active on Telegram

In short, it hurts me a lot

If you want to use it, you can download it from this website rescuetime
